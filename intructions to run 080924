Here's a checklist:

FIRST OF ALL:
CONNECT THE LAPTOP WITH THE SAME WIFI NETWORK AS JETSON NANO, IN ORDER TO USE IT HEADLLESS

Para iniciar o JETSON:
a)- ligar o botao PWR
b)- ao logar a tela monitor ficara blank, pois usaremos o JETSON em modo HEADLESS (sem teclado e sem mouse).
c)- acessar o jetson via REALVNC Viewer.

Apos accessar o sistema operacional.
d)- ABrir o VS CODE (aqui chamado de CODE-OSS)
e)- Abrir 2 CMDs


MAIN ISTRUCTIONS:
1)- Rodar o commando: roscore  (em uma CMD dedicada);
2)- roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch (em outra CMD dedicada)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOT:
1. Verify the Package Name:
Make sure you have the correct package name. The error message suggests that rplidar_ros may not be the correct name of the package or the launch file.

You can check whether the package is correctly installed by running:

bash
Copy code
rospack list | grep rplidar_ros
This command will list any packages that match rplidar_ros. If it doesn't return anything, it means the package isn't installed or you might have the wrong package name.

2. Check the Launch File Name:
Make sure that the launch file you're trying to run exists in the package. The error suggests you're trying to run rplida.launch, but it should probably be rplidar.launch or rplidar_a2.launch. You can verify the available launch files in the package by navigating to the rplidar_ros package directory and listing the contents:

bash
Copy code
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/rplidar_ros/launch
ls
Check if the correct launch file is present. Typically, the file should be named rplidar.launch or something similar.

3. Correct the Launch Command:
If the package is correctly installed and the launch file exists, the command should be:

bash
Copy code
roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch
or

bash
Copy code
roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar_a2.launch
4. Source the Workspace:
Ensure that you've sourced your ROS workspace after building it. Run the following command before launching any ROS nodes:

bash
Copy code
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
You can also add this line to your .bashrc so it is automatically sourced every time you open a terminal:

bash
Copy code
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc



3)- Geralmente o comando alternativo seria a PRINCIPAL, mas as vezes acontece:
An error occurred: Failed to find device after booting, error message: X_LINK_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/rickfogk/darknet/fruit_detection10.py", line 335, in main
    with dai.Device(pipeline) as device:
RuntimeError: Failed to find device after booting, error message: X_LINK_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALSO IF GET GPIO PERMISIONS ISSUES (because the servos):
sudo groupadd -f -r gpio
sudo usermod -aG gpio rickfogk
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
sudo chown root:gpio /dev/gpiochip*
sudo chmod 660 /dev/gpiochip*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rickfogk@rickfogk-desktop:~/darknet$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


TO RUN ARDUINO -> JETSON NANO:
1)- Type: arduino (in a dedicated cmd)
2)- In another cmd, type roscore
3)- rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0 0u ttyACM1(verify port in arduino IDE) or
    rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0 _baud:=115200

4)- If want to check talk between arduino and jetson type: rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
5)- in another CMD type: rostopic echo chatter

CHECKING PUBLISH:
a)- rosnode list; (look for the node tha should be published to /chatter.
b)- rostopic list; (if you dont see /chatter in the list, the Arduino might be publish


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIDAR TROUBLESHOOTING

Edit the rplidar.launch file:
Copy: 
sudo nano /opt/ros/melodic/share/rplidar_ros/launch/rplidar.launch

In this file, look for the line that specifies the serial port. It should look something like this:
xmlCopy: 
<param name="serial_port" type="string" value="/dev/ttyUSB0"/>

Change it to:
xmlCopy<param name="serial_port" type="string" value="/dev/ttyUSB1"/>

Save the file and exit the editor (in nano, you can do this by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).
Now, try to launch the RPLIDAR node:
Copy:
roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch

In a new terminal, check if you're receiving LIDAR data:
Copy:
rostopic echo /scan


If you see data streaming, it means the LIDAR is now connected and working correctly.

Next, modify your Python script to ensure it's subscribing to the correct topic. The LIDAR data is typically published on the /scan topic. Make sure your rospy.Subscriber for LIDAR data looks like this:
pythonCopyrospy.Subscriber("/scan", LaserScan, lidar_callback)

Run your Python script again. You should now see the LIDAR window and receive LIDAR data.

If you're still having issues, please provide:

The output of rosnode list when your RPLIDAR node is running.
The content of the rplidar.launch file after you've made the changes.
Any error messages you're seeing when you run your Python script.

This information will help us further diagnose any remaining issues with the LIDAR connection and data flow. CopyRetry
