Here's a checklist:

FIRST OF ALL:
CONNECT THE LAPTOP WITH THE SAME WIFI NETWORK AS JETSON NANO, IN ORDER TO USE IT HEADLLESS

Para iniciar o JETSON:
a)- ligar o botao PWR
b)- ao logar a tela monitor ficara blank, pois usaremos o JETSON em modo HEADLESS (sem teclado e sem mouse).
c)- acessar o jetson via REALVNC Viewer.

Apos accessar o sistema operacional.
d)- ABrir o VS CODE (aqui chamado de CODE-OSS)
e)- Abrir 2 CMDs


MAIN ISTRUCTIONS:
1)- Rodaro commando: roscore  (em uma CMD dedicada);
2)- roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch



TROUBLESHOOTÃ§
1. Verify the Package Name:
Make sure you have the correct package name. The error message suggests that rplidar_ros may not be the correct name of the package or the launch file.

You can check whether the package is correctly installed by running:

bash
Copy code
rospack list | grep rplidar_ros
This command will list any packages that match rplidar_ros. If it doesn't return anything, it means the package isn't installed or you might have the wrong package name.

2. Check the Launch File Name:
Make sure that the launch file you're trying to run exists in the package. The error suggests you're trying to run rplida.launch, but it should probably be rplidar.launch or rplidar_a2.launch. You can verify the available launch files in the package by navigating to the rplidar_ros package directory and listing the contents:

bash
Copy code
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/rplidar_ros/launch
ls
Check if the correct launch file is present. Typically, the file should be named rplidar.launch or something similar.

3. Correct the Launch Command:
If the package is correctly installed and the launch file exists, the command should be:

bash
Copy code
roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch
or

bash
Copy code
roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar_a2.launch
4. Source the Workspace:
Ensure that you've sourced your ROS workspace after building it. Run the following command before launching any ROS nodes:

bash
Copy code
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
You can also add this line to your .bashrc so it is automatically sourced every time you open a terminal:

bash
Copy code
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc



3)- Geralmente o comando alternativo seria a PRINCIPAL, mas as vezes acontece:
An error occurred: Failed to find device after booting, error message: X_LINK_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/rickfogk/darknet/fruit_detection10.py", line 335, in main
    with dai.Device(pipeline) as device:
RuntimeError: Failed to find device after booting, error message: X_LINK_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND

TRY:
rickfogk@rickfogk-desktop:~/darknet$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
